# About this Workshop

In this workshop, Patrick will introduce you to the ReasonML platform to build
highly type-safe ReactJS applications with the BuckleScript JavaScript compiler.

The goal of this workshop is to build a little webapplication, with following rough outline:

- Setting up the Development environment (VSCode)
- Little introduction to the ReasonML platform
- NextJS as the basis for our application
- Write our first ReasonReact components to build simple UI
- Use React-Hooks to build our first stateful component ("UI where we can click and change stuff")
- Use Prismic.io CMS to provide some data via a GraphQL endpoint
- Wire up the data fetching within our React application (we will use graphql_ppx to make our GraphQL queries type-safe)
- Add some styling with TailwindCSS
- **Extra (optional):** Use now to deploy the app to the cloud



In the end you will have an idea on what Reason is about and you will also be able to build your own ReasonReact components, which can either be used in a standalone ReasonReact application, or may be integrated in any existing ReactJS app.

## Requirements:

- VSCode + installed reason-vscode plugin by Jared Forsyth
- Preferrably MacOS / Linux based systems, but Reason + BuckleScript generally works on all platforms
- Basic understanding of ReactJS
