# Hello Reasoners!

Let's get comfortable with our project structure and editor first. Make sure you have the correct
[`reason-vscode`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaredly.reason-vscode)
extension installed.

If you are super ambitious about the tooling and if you are interested in
checking out TailwindCSS, you might also want to install the [TailwindCSS
Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
as well!

After an initial `yarn bs:build` / `npm run bs:build`, you will have all the Reason source files
built in our project (you will see `*.bs.js` files right next to it when
compiled successfully).

If you are curious on how the BuckleScript compiler nows about your Reason
files, check out the `bsconfig.json` file!


## The Super-Ambitious Goal of this Workshop

In less than 4 hours, we will have hopefully built a very basic hiking webapp
backed by a Prismic CMS for providing the data! The app then should be accessible on
this website via a `/hiking` route!

## How will we get there?

We will start slow, do not worry.

1. A short introduction to modules, types, records and lists
1. Pattern matching, if / elses, functions and labelled arguments
1. Writing our first ReactJS component / discover Reason JSX
1. Small introduction to BuckleScript's interop layer to bind to JS
1. Use all that new knowledge to build the hiking app (most likely we will be working together as a group)

We will try to allocate at least 1 hour for building the app. It will definitely
be a challenge to be done on time, so let's not feel bad when we don't get
through everything right away :-)

## Todo list for our hiking app (only for the end)

- Add a new page `/hiking` as our starting point
- Use the `getInitialProps` API with your `pages/Hiking.re` component to fetch some data from our Prismic endpoint via GraphQL (see `examples/GetInitialPropsExample.re`)
- Render a list of hiking attractions by showing an image, name and short
  description
- When clicking on an item, expand the attraction and show a `RichText`
  description, similarly to how we are displaying markdown
