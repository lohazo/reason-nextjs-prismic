## FAQ

## What's the project structure?

First of all: This is a NextJS project, which is the same framework as you would use in JavaScript.
We just added `bs-platform` (the Reason / JS compiler) as a dependency and then added a few Reason components, which seemlessly
integrate with the ES6 module system (each `*.re` file is compiled to a ES6 module with a `*.bs.js` ending)

- `./components`: Contains independent components (just for structure)
- `./pages`: Pages is a magic folder containing all the pages NextJS should create a route for. Each page is a module exporting a React component as default.
- `./common`: This contains modules with a "utility character"
- `./bindings`: This contains modules which bind to JavaScript modules, such as `nextjs` related components exposed from the `nextjs` package

## Why is there so much existing code in here already?

A goal of this workshop is to give you a rough idea on how it feels to work in
an existing codebase. This is basically a coworker simulation, where your
colleagues already implemented some stuff!

When you are implementing your own components, feel free to get inspiration from what you can find in here.
Copy / Pasting is allowed of course, but make sure that you really understand the code first.

**Following files are quite useful:**

- `./componentes/Text.re`: Contains our html building blocks to enforce some kind of design system (h1, h2, h3, p, ul,...)
- `./tailwind.config.js`: This is the central configuration file for [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Why TailwindCSS?

While doing product development in ReasonReact, we learned from experience that
Tailwind is a great fit. It compiles to a single CSS file and you can also fall
back to plain css by editing the `styles/main.css` as well (Tailwind can also be
used inside CSS with `@apply` directive, check out the Tailwind documentation if
you want to know more how to combine both worlds).

Alternatively you can also use `bs-css`, which is a JS-in-CSS library binding
based on Emotion (probably the most used one in the Reason community). The cool
thing about it is that it's type-safe.
